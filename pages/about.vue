    Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer at Spectric Labs, Inc.where I'm
    building scalable solutions for the US government. My day-to-day technology
    stack looks like Python Golang MongoDB RabbitMQ Docker React.js or Vue.js In
    the past, I've led the rearchitectures of legacy monolithic digital signals
    processing systems to service-oriented architectures, achieving a massive
    increase in throughput, scalability, and reliability. All of these systems
    are still running in operational environments serving customers worldwide.
    Furthermore, I've developed deep learning models and ETL systems to help
    triage and prioritize data for analysts. I graduated from the University of
    Virginia in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineeringand a
    second major in Computer Scienceand in 2016 with a Master of Engineering in
    Electrical Engineeringon the topic of approximating noise waves in microwave
    and millimeter devices. I had the pleasure of conducting research underBobby
    Weikle. In addition, I researched incorporating genetic algorithmsinto the
    multi-objective optimization problem of visual fidelity vs runtime in path
    tracers withWes Weimer. On the side, I enjoy taking photos, trying new
    restaurants and cocktail bars, and traveling. I have the privilege of being
    married to my best friend Erin, father to our wonderful baby girl, and
    doggo-dad to my girl Poppy.
